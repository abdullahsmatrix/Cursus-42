# Cursus 42 - libft
## _Some words about my journey:_
Eureka! I Started 42.

I’ve always been fascinated by calculators, computers, and gadgets. I just wish I had gotten into systems, coding, and algorithms earlier. I was first introduced to coding during my first semester as a Robotics student, and even though I didn’t continue with Robotics, I don’t see that as a failure. Those two semesters actually sparked my interest in programming.

Since then, balancing life as a full-time management student and a full-time employee has made it hard for me to practice coding consistently. I genuinely enjoy it, but my ADHD brain and my lack of structure have often gotten in the way of doing what I love. I’ve joined countless online courses over the years, cs50, freecodecamp, phitron etc. but I’ve always struggled to maintain a streak or stay consistent.

Finally I joined 42. It's a do or die for me now. 

Libft is my very first project since the Piscine, and it’s laid the foundation for so much of what I now understand. Libft not only got me comfortable with C programming syntaxes, it expanded my knowledge to pointer algorithms, recursion, memory manipulation, string handling, function design and decomposition, dynamic memory allocation, buffer management, error handling, Makefiles, and even building my own static library. 

It's beautiful how a simple statement that we speak can be elaborated in code that machine understands and follows. Magical! 

## Project:
**libft** - 100% "ft_split" may have memory issues.
